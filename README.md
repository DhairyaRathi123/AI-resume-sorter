# AI-resume-sorter
I am Dhairya Rathi a 9th grader and this resporatiory is my NLP Bootcamp project
# Breif/Aim of Program:
we live in an era of full of automation so why resume sorting or segregating require human labour.This would not only reduce management burdens but also will be proved as more fairer and faster way for all candidates who have applied
Suppose ABC comapany opened recruitment proposals and candidates startes sending their CVs and resumes on the ABCcompany's website portal. So from there the CVs and Resumes are crisped or parsed down to simple CSV files on the basis of need of the company
so this program is developed to cater that ABC as backend software which processes and ranks thousands of candidates on the criteria set by them
# Future Prospects
Firstly, we can add chatbot type system which inputs the criteria which the company want to set
Second, till now, it support csv after words we can code it in a way that it can parses to any medium be it pdf or docx by using module like doc2txt , cv2 etc..
afterwards, we can add more feature apart from resume and after evolution this simple data science project can be full fledged AGI HR bot and we invite you alter the codes and make this dream real.
